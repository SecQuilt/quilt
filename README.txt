Quilt is in early stages of development.  You will need the following python
    modules installed:

python-pyro
python-daemon
python-argparse

The rest should be std python, but if you find something, add it above.

You should now go read test/README.txt

Only the very willing should bother installing quilt.  If you did really want
to you would do:

$ sudo bin/quilt install

Then you could start and stop quilt with

$ sudo quilt stop
$ sudo quilt start


However there is no deployment documentation that instructs you how to
configure Quilt.  For more informaiton contact dhkarimi@sei.cmu.edu
