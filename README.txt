Quilt is in early stages of development.  You will need the modules:

python-pyro
python-daemon
python-argparse

The rest should be std python, but if you find something, add it above.

To run:

$ test/bin/test_start


This will leave some daemons running.  You can run this to stop them

$ test/bin/test_stop
