quilt 0.1 basic sources tests
-----------------------------

Module: basic_sources_testcase

Type: Integration Test

Internal Dependencies:
    *All classes
    configuration setup from quilt_test
    seeded values in mock test logs

External Dependencies:
    python-unittest
    python-pyro

Prototype:
    some_test.py

Responsibilities:
    Perform a simple query of a multiple basic data sources.  Also pass
query code to ensure that it is parsed correctly

Classes:

    class BasicSoucesTestcase()

        NOTE   : Depend on seed values from BasicSourceTestcase plus
            
            "Now we are testing with python"
