quilt 0.1 order tests
-------------------------


Module: order_testcase

Type: Integration Test

Internal Dependencies:
    *All classes
    configuration setup from quilt_test, including source defined as "out of
        order numbers"

External Dependencies:
    python-unittest

Prototype:
    None

Responsibilities:
    Perform a query on an out of order source to assure that the results are
    transformed to be in order

Classes:

    class orderTestcase()

            
        def setUp():
            """Setup the query master with some patterns used by the tests"""

            configuration of the source pattern indicates that the data is out
            of order and quilt should transform it to ordered behind the
            scenes.  We simply performa  query in the normal matter and assure
