quilt 0.1 quilt_data design
---------------------------

Module: quilt_data

Type: Library

External Dependencies:

Responsibilities:
    Provide functions for manipulating quilt compliant dictionaries.  Python
    lets us write whatever we want into dicts, we want to use dicts because
    they are fast and built in, but we don't want to loose control of the
    data, so provide an interface for working with standardized dicts, which
    we call "Specs" or specifications

Inheritance and variations:

    query's are basicaly patterns    
    But there are source and regular flavors
    
Collections:

    all *_spec are objects, and all *_specs are collections

Functions:

    Object accessors:
        ${object}_[get/set/create/tryget/del/trydel]

    These functions (named by the abreviations) are available for the 
    following objects:

General Objects:
    var_spec:   Variable Specification
        Variable specifications are used to define parameters and arguments
        to patterns and queries.  They are not "subtyped" for each use but
        any object containing variables uses them 

Top Level Objects:
    pat_spec:   Pattern Specification
        Patterns are top level templates for queries.  You can instantiate
        a pattern a create a query that will gather results from multiple
        sources

    src_var_mapping_spec:    Source Variable Mapping Specification
        pat_spec's have a collection of these.  They provide instruction to
        the system as to which variables in the pattern specification map to
        which source variables in a source pattern

    query_spec: Query Specification
        Queries are instantiated patterns.  They have values set from the 
        usert that completely fill out a pattern, providing enough
        information to then query multiple sources.

Source Level Objects:
    src_pat_spec:   Source Pattern Specification
        Source patterns provide information to the source manager about a
        set of data that can be retrieved from that source

    src_query_spec: Source Query Specification
        Source Queries are instantiated Source Patterns.  They will have all
        variables needed by the source pattern, and those variables will have
        values provided
    
    src_spec:   Source Specification
        Source Specification's define details about the source, such as
        which patterns are available for the source
