quilt 0.1 quilt_data design
---------------------------

Module: quilt_data

Type: Library

External Dependencies:

Responsibilities:
    Provide functions for manipulating quilt compliant dictionaries.  Python
    lets us write whatever we want into dicts, we want to use dicts because
    they are fast and built in, but we don't want to loose control of the
    data, so provide an interface for working with standardized dicts, which
    we call "Specs" or specifications

Inheritance and variations:

    query's are basicaly patterns    
    But there are source and regular flavors
    
    TODO Decide if just alising query functions to pattern functions is
        sufficeent
