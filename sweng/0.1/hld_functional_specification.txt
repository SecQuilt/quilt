Query Master
------------

    quilt_qmd
        start       # start the daemon
        stop        # stop the daemon
        status      # print status of the daemon
        restart     # stop then start the daemon

        The Query master daemon will run in the background and support the
        statefullness of the system.  It will listen for user queries and
        support returning the results to the user.  It does the coordination

    quilt_submit
        -q QUERY    # A query to run on the system
        [-e EMAIL]  # comma seperated list of emails to supply notifications
        [-y]        # whether to automatically confirm the query

        Quilt Submit will allow submission of a query.  It will communicate with
        the query master, recieve estimated time/space metrics of teh query,
        get user confirmation (if no -y), then deliver the query, to the master
        for processing, print the query id, and then exit.

    quilt_q
        [-qid QUERY_ID]     # optional argument, which query to check

        Quilt status will display information about queries in the queue.  If id
        is specified, only that query's information will be displayed

    quilt_status
        
        Display information about the quilt system, including registered
        source managers

Source Manager
--------------
    
    quilt_smd
        start       # start the daemon
        stop        # stop the daemon
        status      # print status of the daemon
        restart     # stop then start the daemon

        The source manager daemon holds the statefull information needed to
        manage the query source.  I will listen for requests from the query 
        master and return query results to it.
 
    quilt_source_query
        conditions  # the conditions of the query

        quilt_source_query will be invoked by the source manager daemon when a
        query is requested.  The conditions of the query are used to filter
        the data source, and results are returned to the query master
