quilt 0.1 functional specification
----------------------------------

Quilt is a system that consists of three phases: retreival, reasoning, and
resolution. The retrieval phase provides for a pattern-driven distributed
query across multiple data types. The reasoning phase filters query results
using an abductive logic filter to determine complete and meaningfully partial
matches between the results and the original pattern. The resolution phase
permits further exploration of the results via analytics, including (but not
restricted to) summation, time-series, and contingency-table.

Query Master
------------

    quilt_qmd
        start       # start the daemon
        stop        # stop the daemon
        status      # print status of the daemon
        restart     # stop then start the daemon

        The Query master daemon will run in the background and support the
        statefullness of the system.  It will listen for user queries and
        support returning the results to the user.  It does the coordination

    quilt_submit
        QUERY    # A query to run on the system
        [-e EMAIL]  # comma seperated list of emails to supply notifications
        [-y]        # whether to automatically confirm the query
        [-l LEVEL]  # log level (DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR), default is WARN

        Quilt Submit will allow submission of a query.  It will communicate with
        the query master, recieve estimated time/space metrics of teh query,
        get user confirmation (if no -y), then deliver the query, to the master
        for processing, print the query id, and then exit.

    quilt_q
        [-qid QUERY_ID]     # optional argument, which query to check
        [-l LEVEL]  # log level (DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR), default is WARN

        Quilt queue will display information about queries in the queue.  If id
        is specified, only that query's information will be displayed, if that 
        id is not present nothing is displayed

    quilt_status
        [-l LEVEL]  # log level (DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR), default is WARN
        
        Display information about the quilt system, including registered
        source managers

Source Manager
--------------
    
    quilt_smd
        start       # start the daemon
        stop        # stop the daemon
        status      # print status of the daemon
        restart     # stop then start the daemon

        The source manager daemon holds the statefull information needed to
        manage the query source.  I will listen for requests from the query 
        master and return query results to it.
 
    quilt_source_query
        conditions  # the conditions of the query

        quilt_source_query will be invoked by the source manager daemon when a
        query is requested.  The conditions of the query are used to filter
        the data source, and results are returned to the query master
