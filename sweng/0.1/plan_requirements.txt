quilt 0.1 requirements
----------------------

Quilt 0.1 is a system which brings together multiple types of data and provides
a distributed mechanism for querying the data.

* Queries are submitted from an analyst system with no or partial local data
* Queries reference multiple types of data and cross refer attributes of that
    data
* Differnt types of data can be housed at together, or at differnt locations,
    on an analyst's machine, or in the field
* A Minnimum ammount of data should be brought back to a central system
* data primarily remains in its "natural" location (determined by its
    individual collection system
* Queries should support specification based on temporal order of events
* Pattern matching of events supports temporal operators (BEFORE, CONCURRENT, 
        UNTIL)
* results of query will be presented to the user as a collection of temporal
    sequences of events.
