quilt 0.1 requirements
----------------------

Quilt 0.1 is a system which brings together multiple types of data and 
    provides a distributed mechanism for querying the data.

Queries:
* Queries are submitted from an analyst system with no or partial local data
* Queries reference multiple types of data and cross refer attributes of that
    data
* Queries should support specification based on temporal order of events
* Pattern matching of events supports temporal operators ("UNTIL, CONCURRENT, 
        FOLLOWS)
* Default values for query parameters can be provided in a source pattern or
    in the quilt pattern
* A default value specified in a quilt pattern will overide a default value
    set in the source pattern



* Quilt Grammer is supported for queries:

    pattern ::= until(pattern,pattern) |
        concurrent(pattern,pattern,...) |
        follows(dt, pattern, pattern) |
        expr
    expr ::= and(expr, expr, ...) |
        or (expr, expr, ...) |
        not(expr) | condition
    condition ::= Term > Term | Term == Term |
        term < term | term >= term |
        term != term | term <= term |
        term
    term ::= term Ë† term | term * term |
        term / term | factor
    factor ::= factor + factor |
        factor - factor | value
    value ::= ( pattern ) | literal |
        source.field
    literal ::= string | numeric
    source ::= identifier
    field ::= identifier | identifier [ term ]

Semantic Behavior:
* Query code will suppourt arbitary textual substitution with pattern
    variables, when a default for the pattern variable is defined

* The expression field < field means all rows on LHS with LHS field value< min of rows on RHS
* The expression field <= field means all rows on LHS with LHS field value <= min of rows on RHS
* The expression field > field means all rows on LHS with LHS field value > max of rows on RHS
* The expression field >= field means all rows on LHS with LHS field value >= max of rows on RHS
* The expression field < factor means all rows on LHS with LHS field value < factor on RHS
* The expression field <= factor means all rows on LHS with LHS field value <= factor on RHS
* The expression field > factor means all rows on LHS with LHS field value > factor on RHS
* The expression field >= factor means all rows on LHS with LHS field value >= factor on RHS
* The expression field == factor means all rows on LHS with LHS field value == factor on RHS

* The expression field1 and field2 means all rows where the values for field1
    and field2 intersect
* The expression field1 or field2 means all rows where the values for field1
    and field2 intersect

Results:
* results of query will be presented to the user as a collection of unique 
    temporal sequences of events.

Data:
* Differnt types of data can be housed at together, or at differnt locations,
    on an analyst's machine, or in the field
* A Minnimum ammount of data should be brought back to a central system
* data primarily remains in its "natural" location (determined by its
    individual collection system)
* Intimate knowledge of a type of data's native query system need not be known
    to the central system

Tasks:
* Mine log files for events of interest
    ** using regular expressions
* All functionality shall be easily verifiable via automated testing
