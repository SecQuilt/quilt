quilt 0.1 development strategy
------------------------------

c1.Infrastructure
    Setup shells of Query Master, Source Master, and Source1

    Design
        Design testing framework
        Design initial deployment strategy
    
    Develop
        create shell applications
        create testing framework
        
    Test
        Execute basic operations ad hoc
        Run automated test suite
        

c2.Communication
    Provide 2-way communication between components
    
    Design
        Design integration with condor
        Design data interchange formats
        Design schema sharing system
        Design tests of the functionality
	    Design prototype pattern input format
            in-fix pattern specification language (e.g., some logical
                expressions)
            query-by example (e.g., collection of data samples with query
                attributes/relations identified)
            SQL-form query (e.g., closer to a programming language)
            other (e.g., whatever bright ideas we have later)
	

    Implement

    Test
        1. Single-source pattern (e.g., restatement to rwfilter)
        2. Null pattern (e.g., TRUE (producing whole database) or FALSE 
            (producing no events)) on small database
        3. Dual-source pattern without cross-reference (e.g. flow.sip=1.2.3.4 
            and dns.resolution=1.2.3.4)
        4. Dual-source pattern with cross-reference (e.g., flow.sip=1.2.3.4 and
            dns.resolution=flow.dip)
        5. Multiple source pattern without cross-reference
        6. Multiple source pattern with cross reference

c3.Adapation
    Adopt a data source in the query master

c4.Execution
    Execute query specified from Query Master on the Source Master

    Design
        formalize query format
        formalize result format

c4.Return
    Return query results from Source Master to Query Master

c5.Evaluation
    Determine and fix weak points and refactor
    Demo Prototype to likely adopting staeholders and gather reactions

c6.UI
    Polish user interaction points

c7.Integration
    Perform integration of entire workflow, fill in TODO's
