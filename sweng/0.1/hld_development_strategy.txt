quilt 0.1 development strategy
------------------------------

c1.Infrastructure
    Setup shells of Query Master, Source Master, and Source1

    Design
        Design testing framework
        Design initial deployment strategy
    
    Develop
        create shell applications
        create testing framework
        
    Test
        Execute basic operations ad hoc
        Run automated test suite
        

c2.Basic Source
    Provide 2-way communication between components, such that one
    simple datasource an be queried and answers can be returned
    
    Design
        Design workload managment such that it can be extended to condor in
            the future.
        Design initial version of data interchange formats, do not focus on
            the permenance of the descision, but focus on capability for this
            basic source
        Design schema sharing system
            The source will publish an event spec, and query spec to let the
            master know what the capabilities are
        Design tests of the functionality
	

    Develop
        Stand up in order of the least scaffolding.
        
        data structures for schema sharing
        
        data source adapter for simple source

        query agent for querying the source

        workload managment wrapper

    Test
        1. Single-source pattern (e.g., restatement to source)
        2. Null pattern (e.g., TRUE (producing whole database) or FALSE 
            (producing no events)) on small database

c3.Adapation
    Adopt a query language

    Design prototype pattern input format
        in-fix pattern specification language (e.g., some logical
            expressions)
        query-by example (e.g., collection of data samples with query
            attributes/relations identified)
        SQL-form query (e.g., closer to a programming language)
        other (e.g., whatever bright ideas we have later)

    Test
        3. Dual-source pattern without cross-reference (e.g. flow.sip=1.2.3.4 
            and dns.resolution=1.2.3.4)
            dns.resolution=flow.dip)
        4. Dual-source pattern with cross-reference (e.g., flow.sip=1.2.3.4 and
        5. Multiple source pattern without cross-reference
        6. Multiple source pattern with cross reference
c4.Execution
    Execute query specified from Query Master on the Source Master

    Design
        formalize query format
        formalize result format

c4.Return
    Return query results from Source Master to Query Master

c5.Evaluation
    Determine and fix weak points and refactor
    Demo Prototype to likely adopting staeholders and gather reactions

c6.UI
    Polish user interaction points

c7.Integration
    Perform integration of entire workflow, fill in TODO's
