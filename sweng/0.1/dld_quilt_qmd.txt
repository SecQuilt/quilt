        string RegisterSourceManager(
            string nameServerHost,      # ip address of nameserver
            int nameServerPort,         # port for the nameserver
            string sourceManagerName    # name of the source manager on

    def run():
        # Use QuiltConfig to read in configuration 
        # access the registrar's host and port number from config

        # register the Query Master with the PyRo Daemon
        # start the Daemon's event loop
