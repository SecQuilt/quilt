quilt 0.1 issues
----------------

Open:

    ISSUE001
    There are some assumptions in the interface, and query instantiation logic
        currently that prevent one source from beign used twice in a query.  
        we can not fix it at this time, we need the power first to specify
        multiple source patterns in one pattern before we can thing it
        through.


    ISSUE003
    Command lines don't work!
    quilt/bin/quilt_define

I only get the log options showing:

[jdav@n005 ~]$ ./quilt/bin/quilt_define  -h
usage:
        Define a pattern to the query master.  A pattern is the template for a
        query.  The specified name of the pattern may be modified so as to
        become unique.  The official name of the pattern will be displayed.
        quilt_define will not return until pattern is defined or an error has
        occured.  It will output the finalized (unique) name for the pattern

       [-h] [-l [LOG_LEVEL]]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -l [LOG_LEVEL], --log-level [LOG_LEVEL]
                        logging level (DEBUG,INFO,WARN,ERROR) default: WARN

My desire was for it to show the other options that I set in quilt_define. That are reflected in the functional specification.   But the extra options, though not listed in the usage will actually work because I can do the .-v. and .-m. options and those tests are running.

So it is hopefully fixable the way it is designed, where we centralize the log initialization.  If necessary when fixed, please update the design documentation quilt/sweng/0.1  . Although I only mentio.ned quilt_define, I believe the same is true for all of the executable scripts that are listed in the functional specification.  Send me a note if you want we can talk at lunchtime tomorrow for a few minutes
