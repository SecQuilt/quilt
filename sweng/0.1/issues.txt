Identified for testability cycle (c3):
    Issues 3,4,6,7

Open:

    ISSUE001
    There are some assumptions in the interface, and query instantiation logic
        currently that prevent one source from beign used twice in a query.  
        we can not fix it at this time, we need the power first to specify
        multiple source patterns in one pattern before we can thing it
        through.


    ISSUE003
    Command lines don't work!

    ISSUE004
    Need to remove lastQuery stuff from smd and unit tests

    ISSUE005
    Sources are a total hack, most notably not supporting concurent searches
        at this time

    ISSUE006
    No test cases are defined which test default heiarchy functionality

    ISSUE007
    Strategy needs to be decided for if test patterns are redefined every time
        are they reused?  Are they removed after completed?  Some kind of
        tradeoff analyscis needs to inform a decision on this matter, for now
        they are hacked

    ISSUE008
    Need standard way of output to stdout so that automated tests can be
    more reliable and check results more betterly
