----------------

Open:

    ISSUE001
    There are some assumptions in the interface, and query instantiation logic
        currently that prevent one source from beign used twice in a query.  
        we can not fix it at this time, we need the power first to specify
        multiple source patterns in one pattern before we can thing it
        through.


    ISSUE003
    Command lines don't work!

    ISSUE004
    Need to remove lastQuery stuff from smd and unit tests

    ISSUE005
    Sources are a total hack, most notably not supporting concurent searches
        at this time

Closed:

    ISSUE002
    souce manager won't start!
