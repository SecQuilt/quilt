quilt 0.1 source_query design
-----------------------------

TODO.... Not complete, not needed for 0.1.c2

Module: source_query

Type: Library

External Dependencies:

Internal Dependencies:
    quilt_core

Responsibilities:
    Provide the base for an extension point for differnt kinds of source
    queries.

Classes:
    class SourceQuery 

    NOTE:   In the future, this class will allow us to submit the query to a
        scheduler, and suport scalability.  For now we just run the query

    void __init(
        sourceManagerName, 
        sourceManagerHost,
        sourceManagerPort,
        sourceQuerySpec)

        # store these things as member variables

    void Query()

        # get the typename of the pattern class from the source spec
        # TODO in the future, run dynamic import 
        # create instance of specified class
