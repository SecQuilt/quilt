    class BasicTestcase()
        def test_basic_query()
            # call quilt_submit "find me again [uniqueval] " 
            #   (check return code)
            # sleep 2 seconds
            # Use QuiltConfig, Call GetSourceManagers, for each one
                # use pyro, create proxy for the smd
                # call GetLastQuery()
                # assure it is equal to "find me again [uniqueval]"
            # check qmd to be sure that all quilt_submit's have unregistered
            # do this by accessing Config, finding qmd name,
            # create pyro proxy for qmd, call
            # getClients(type(QuiltSubmit))
            # make sure list is empty
            # TODO parameterize this test if needed, could fail if anyone is
            # running simultaneiously
