quilt 0.1 quilt_variable dictionary design
------------------------------------------

Module: var_dict

Type: Library

External Dependencies:

Responsibilities:
    One data structure that is needed is known in short as a Variable
    Dictionary.  Actually is is a nested dictionary which maps source
    variables to variables.  These variable mappings are grouped in the
    context of a query, by the instance of the source query, the source
    pattern, and the srouce.

Schema:
    
    map{source:
       map{sourcePattern:
           map{sourcePatternInstance:
               map{srcVar:Var}}}}


Functions:

     
def create()
    # return an empty dictionary

def src(varDict, source,append):
    # add a source to the varDict

def src_pat(varDict, source, sourcePattern,append ):
    # add a source pattern to the varDict

def src_pat_inst(varDict, source, sourcePattern, sourcePatternInstance,append):
    # add a source pattern instance to the varDict
    
def set_var(varDict, source, sourcePattern, sourcePatternInstance,
        sourceVariable, variable,append):
    # add a complete variable mapping to the varDict
    # if append is false, do not grow the collection dynamically 
    # to add the new variable
