Pattern lifecycle for testing (ISSUE007)

Goal priority:
    1.  realistic test coverage
    2.  complete test coverage
    3.  low overhead per new test/testcase
    4.  low core test code complexity

Sensitiviy Points:

    Adding/removing patterns before/after each test
        low realism
        high coverage
        medium overhead
        low core

    Adding/removing patterns before/after group of tests
        med-high realism
        med-high coverage
        low overhead
        med-high core

    Adding patterns before each test, never removing them
        med realism
        high-low coverage
        low overhead
        low core

Decision:
    
    Adding/removign patterns before each group of tests is an effective
        balance between instantly defining and undefining them, and
        letting them accumulate forever.
