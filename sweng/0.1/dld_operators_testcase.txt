------------------------


Module: operators_testcase

Type: Integration Test

Internal Dependencies:
    *All classes
    configuration setup from quilt_test
    seeded values in *_holiday sources

External Dependencies:
    python-unittest

Prototype:
    Adhoc prototyping of queries, see hld_development_strategy.txt

Responsibilities:
    Perform quilt queries that will excersize the logic of the quilt operators
    like less than (<)

Classes:

    class OperatorsTestcase()

            
        def setUp():
            """Setup the query master with some patterns used by the tests"""

            # get the full source name for christian and secular sources

            # define template pattern code string

                ('$CHRISTIAN',
                'grep')['paradesize'])['paradesize'] < 100"

            # replace CHRISTIAN and SECULAR variables in the template with
            #   full source names

            # call quilt_define with the pattern code and name query
            #   operators_lesthan

            submits the operators_lesthan pattern.  Checks that that the
            result only contains boxing day
            """
            
            # call quilt submit -y operators_lesthan
            # Assure proper execution, and get results from quilt_history
