quilt 0.1 testing specification
-------------------------------
    
Complex logic will be Unit Tested

This is a distributed system, and a lot of functionality will need integration
testing.  Integration tests will be done using scripts to start daemons, and
then using the unit test infrastructure to execute test code.

test_start script will ensure that testing daemons have stoped, then start
    the daemons, and then run the test driver, quilt_test

quilt_test
    the test driver, quilt_test will serially execute all tests defined in
    by the patterns in the configuration

test_stop
    script will stop all daemons

 
Unit Testing vs Integration Testing
-----------------------------------

Although Unit testing of complex functions is strongly encouraged.  We have
    chosen to use pyunit as a tester for our integration tests.  Integration
    tests of all functionality are absolutely required.  With a small
    development staff we can not afford any regressions.
