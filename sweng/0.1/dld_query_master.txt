quilt 0.1 Query Master design
-----------------------------

Module: query_master

Type: library

Internal Dependencies:
    quilt_core
    
External Dependenies:
    python-pyro(4)
    python-daemon
    threading

Prototypes:
    nested.py

Responsibilities:
    provide QueryMaster remote api 

Classes:

    class QueryMaster 

        
        
        # create a lock for this class, coarse grained but
        # proably good enough.
        self._lock = threading.lock()

        # Register a client with the query master
        string RegisterClient(   # return key name for the client
            string nameServerHost,      # ip address of nameserver
            int nameServerPort,         # port for the nameserver
            string clientName           # name of the source manager on
                                        # the specified nameserver
            string clientType           # name of the type of the client
            )
            # acquire lock
            # determine unique name for source master (hopefuly just using the
            # passed in name, but double check registered list.
            # Store in list of registered clients
            # use object's name and type to key it in the registerd list
            # return the determined name

            Notes:
               The returned name should be stored by client so that it knows how
               itself is known to the QMD

                Previously was attempting to call back to client in here, this
                wasnot a good idea.  First of all it doesn't work, possibly
                because calling pyro daemon was not given enough sleep to get
                into the listening state.  Even if that was resolved, our
                current locking strategy is at the funciton level.  We do not
                want to call out of the function with the lock on!
             
        # UnRegister a client with the query master
        void UnRegisterClient(
            string clientType               # client type

                                            #   recognize a client
        )
