quilt 0.1 pattern defaults testcase
-----------------------------------

Module: pattern_defaults_testcase

Type: Integration Test

Internal Dependencies:
    *All classes
    configuration setup from quilt_test

External Dependencies:
    python-unittest

Prototype:
    see any unittest in seiscripts

Responsibilities:
    Quilt allows the specification of parameters and optional defaults that
        will be used if an explicit value is not given.  There is a heiarchy
        to the order in which defaults are used.  This is moderatly logically
        complex and thus it is the responsibility of this module to test it.

Classes:

    class PatternDefaultsTestcase()

        NOTE: Our test file is seeded with some unique values we can look for
            "Occurs_1_time"
            "Occurs_3_times"
            "Occurs_3_times"
            "Occurs_3_times"

        NOTE: (ISSUE007)
            pattern definition code may be moved once it is known where
            and how pattern lifecycle managment is delt with in integration
            tests
